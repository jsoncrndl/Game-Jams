# Super Charged Racer!
Your phone is almost dead! Race the charger to the phone as fast as possible to keep it from dying.

## Obstacles
There will be a few generic obstacles blocking the way to the phone

1. Stop - solid obstacle, hitting stops velocity in direction of normal
2. Slow area - entering area decreases speed to 70%

## Speed
The charger will accelerate up to a max speed over time. Hitting an obstacle will cause speed to be lost. Hitting a boost will cause the speed to temporarily increase above max.

The longer you go without hitting obstacles, the more your boost meter charges. Holding shift uses your boost meter to gain additional speed.

## Controls
Space - gain speed
Shift - boost
W/S - rotate

Holding W/S rotates the charger slightly up. Releasing the keys rotates the charger back to forward.
