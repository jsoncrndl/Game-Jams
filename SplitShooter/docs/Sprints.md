# Sprints

## Sprint 1
Created shooter movement, projectile, and temporary enemy script. Did not finish rotating the player to face movement direction, which I will do first thing next sprint. Next sprint will focus on making enemies spawn, destroy, and keeping track of points for a single game instance. I will also likely switch to only 4 lives (2 splits) to keep the games shorter and code easier.

## Sprint 2
Created shooter rotation, methods for keeping score, and a simple arena area. I did not get to move my spawning script into this project yet, which I will need to do next. I should spend the next sprint on getting the camera moving around. I will create a temporary prefab with a button to split the camera.

## Sprint 3
Mostly finished the splitting. There are a few problems still with the camera, but the new games can spawn when the player gets hit.

## Sprint 4
Got enemy spawning working. There are a few problems, such as enemies needing an outer wall to block enemies. Level code works, just need to set values for each level. Next step is to finish the levels, then spend the rest of the time on polish and presentation.

## Sprint 5
I spent the sprint setting the values for the different levels and adjusting gameplay. Still has a camera glitch, needs sfx and menu. 

## Sprint 6
I spent his whole sprint fixing bugs. There is still a bit of a camera glitch, but the game works better now. I just had time to add a game over menu, then added a reset button a minute after time ran out. I would still like to come back to this and add screen-shake, hit-stop, and sfx another time.
